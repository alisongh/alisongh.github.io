"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"

Have you got the error when you try to open a Python file from github?

Sometimes github fails to render the ipynb notebooks, and this is annoying sometimes because we don't want to download a file everytime without preview it. So! There's a solution.

**Step One**

<p>Open the link:  <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/</a>.</p>


**Step Two**

Paste the location of a Jupyter Notebook

**Step Three**

Click "Go!"

Yeah! Now you can preview the file!
