To mark a post as multipage, simply use the YAML front-matter:
You can then choose where the post is split into pages in two different ways:

{% page_break %}
You can do both at the same time too.

Read the rest of this document for extensive customisation options, including page-numbering, page titles, automatic anchor-link rewriting, and more.

Please note that, in each case, you can specify a customisation option in your Jekyll site's _config.yml file as well as in each specific post. A post's settings will override the site-wide setting, as you'd expect.
