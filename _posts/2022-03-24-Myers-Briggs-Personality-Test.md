## ENTJ: Extroversion, Intuition, Thinking, Judging
ENTJs are generally organized, decisive, direct, innovative, and driven to succeed. They maintain a focus on the future
and are inclined to see the big picture. They are interested in new ideas and are able to understand difficult or complex
information. The ENTJ also tends to intuitively identify and internally evaluate a wide range of possibilities. They are able
to see what is not currently apparent and use their insight to create connections, identify solutions, or solve problems.
ENTJs often enjoy interacting with others and usually know a large number of people. They tend to be energetic, confident,
and exhibit a strong or intense personality that may overwhelm others. They place an importance on honesty and value
being perceived as competent. Some ENTJs may be distant and unfriendly while others are approachable and sensitive.
The difference in disposition is often due to the time they take to reflect on their inner thoughts and ideas.
The ENTJ often has a natural inclination towards leadership. They typically want to feel in control or be in a position of
influence. They are generally hard working, embrace a challenge, and have high standards. They tend to see the flaws of an
inefficient system and will identify a more effective way to complete a task or handle a situation. The ENTJ is often able to
take complex ideas or future possibilities and create a vision and corresponding plan. They will then organize and direct
people, situations, and resources to meet these goals. ENTJs are often focused on the task and may neglect to consider
the needs of the people they are organizing. They may also struggle when working with people who do not have similar
strengths.

ENTJs typically use a logical and objective approach to analyze information and ideas. They are not overly interested in
specific facts or details and would rather focus on the big picture. They desire to create closure by making quick judgments
and decisions. They often base their decisions on logic and rarely consider their values, feelings, or the potential impact on
others. Some ENTJs should be cautious that they have gathered sufficient information to make their decision. The ENTJ
may struggle with judging others or being critical. They should be cautious that they separate their criticism from the
person and focus on the issue or action. They may feel emotionally connected to people or ideas but will usually suppress
or hide these feelings. The ENTJ will often care a lot for others but may create the perception that they are distant and
hardhearted because of their rational and logical decisions.
